## Design Scope and Assumptions
- **In scope:** [What this lab implements]
- **Out of scope:** [What this lab intentionally does not implement]
- **Assumptions:** [Clock frequency, reset behavior, data width, memory model, or
other assumptions]
- **Limitations:** [Known limitations or simplified behaviors]
## Requirements
| Requirement | Description | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-01 | [The design shall ...] | [Test case, waveform, calculation, or
inspection] |
| REQ-02 | [The design shall ...] | [Test case, waveform, calculation, or
inspection] |
| REQ-03 | [The design shall ...] | [Test case, waveform, calculation, or
inspection] |
## Architecture
### Timing or Behavioral Summary
Save diagrams in the repository's `images/` folder. Use relative paths so they
display on GitHub.

## Implementation
### Source Code
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`[module].v`](LINK_TO_IMPLEMENTATION_CODE) | [Primary implementation module] |
| [`[component].v`](LINK_TO_COMPONENT_CODE) | [Supporting component] |
| [`[testbench].v`](LINK_TO_TESTBENCH_CODE) | [Verification testbench] |
### Implementation Notes
- [Explain one important design decision.]
- [Identify any parameterization, reusable module, or interface convention.]
- [Document any deliberate simplification made for this lab.]
## Verification
### Verification Strategy
The design is verified using **[simulation, formal checks, hardware testing, or
another method]**.
Verification covers:
- [Normal operating case]
- [Boundary or maximum-value case]
- [Reset or initialization case]
- [Invalid, stalled, or exceptional case, if applicable]
### Testbench and Waveform
Save screenshots and waveform images in the repository's `images/` folder.
![Testbench or waveform](images/[testbench-screenshot-filename].png)
The testbench source is available [*here*](LINK_TO_TESTBENCH_CODE).
### Results
| Test Case | Expected Result | Observed Result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC-01 — [Name] | [Expected behavior] | [Observed behavior] | Pass / Fail |
| TC-02 — [Name] | [Expected behavior] | [Observed behavior] | Pass / Fail |
| TC-03 — [Name] | [Expected behavior] | [Observed behavior] | Pass / Fail |
## Reproduction Instructions
### Tools and Versions
- **Simulator / synthesis tool:** [Name and version]
- **Language / standard:** [Verilog/SystemVerilog version]
- **Operating system:** [macOS, Windows, Linux, or other]
- **Additional dependencies:** [List any required tools or libraries]
### Build and Run
```bash
